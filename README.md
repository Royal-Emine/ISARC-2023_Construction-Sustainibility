Creating a Prediction Model with utmost accuracy to achieve highest Compressive Strength in cement based on multiple features composed in a dataset of a huge amount of data


The dataset is a combination of data points from multiple research papers. Its expected to split the dataset with an 80-20 split for training and testing. The prediction parameter should be the compressive strength, and the rest of the other parameters can be the input.
