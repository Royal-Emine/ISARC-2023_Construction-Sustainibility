# Creating a Prediction Model with utmost accuracy to achieve highest Compressive Strength in cement based on multiple features composed in a dataset of a huge amount of data


The dataset is a combination of data points from multiple research papers. Its expected to split the dataset with an 80-20 split for training and testing. The prediction parameter should be the compressive strength, and the rest of the other parameters can be the input.


With the increasing awareness of sustainable development, reusing and recycling waste is gaining importance. Research has shown that a lot of material in construction and demolition waste can be effectively used in new construction. Can we use machine learning to predict the strength of concrete containing such waste materials?
